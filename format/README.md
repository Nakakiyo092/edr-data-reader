# Conversion rules

1. Search the value from the "Value table" row. If found, it's the result.
2. If not found, convert the value as described in the "Conversion" row, where E and N are:

* E: Converted value
* N: Raw value (unsigned integer)

NOTE: The byte order for multi-byte data is defined neither in GB nor in ISO.
